# Rust Notes
Going to need a rust cheat sheet to relearn this language.

## Berylium Library
Requires that SDL2 be available. In windows I was able to add the needed dll to the debug folder to get cargo run to function as expected. 

Pong is basic and essentially only Semi-functioning but sufficient to draw windows and make further projects so I'm satisfied for this repository.
